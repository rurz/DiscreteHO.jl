# DiscreteHO.jl

`DiscreteHO.jl` stands for _**Discrete** **H**armonic **O**scillator_, meaning that this package contains the methods, procedures and functions who are related to the discretization of the harmonic oscillator. The discretization is based on the analytical properties of the compact algebra _su(2)_.

The aim of the package is, at first, provide the functions who define the related discrete system. This is because, although there exists packages who treat some aspects of the methods here presented, they are dispersed and not in a fully functional form. This little package has the purpose to be the one who integrates the definitions and procedures.
